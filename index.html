            <h3>Week 1: HTML, CSS, Git, Github</h3>
            <p>My Week 1 was brushing off of the assigned prework.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, I learned setting up the Github account and Git commands.</p>
            <p>It would be interesting to utilize the CSS Grid method to create a blog site.  I'll put in some time to research this method this week.</p>

            <h3>Week 3: Arrays, Functions, Objects</h3>
            <p>My Week 3 was learning about Arrays, Functions, and Objects.</p>

            <p>A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.</p>
            <P>The struggle of understanding how loops work can be profounding. My goal of the month: Let's try to review the class work more and practice more.
